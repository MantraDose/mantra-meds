Now that you have the spec.md AND/OR requirements.md, please break those down into an actionable tasks list with strategic grouping and ordering, by following these instructions:

# Task List Creation

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Analyze spec and requirements**: Read and analyze the spec.md and/or requirements.md to inform the tasks list you will create.
2. **Plan task execution order**: Break the requirements into a list of tasks in an order that takes their dependencies into account.
3. **Group tasks by specialization**: Group tasks that require the same skill or stack specialization together (backend, api, ui design, etc.)
4. **Create Tasks list**: Create the markdown tasks list broken into groups with sub-tasks.
5. **Call out user-supplement tasks:** For each spec, identify steps only the user can perform (env, dashboard/config, deploy, manual verification). Add a **"Your Tasks (supplement implementation)"** section (or "Work you need to complete") near the top of the task list with a table: **When** (e.g. "Before Task Group 1", "After Task Group 3") and **What you need to do**. If there are no such steps for a given spec, the section can state "None for this spec" or list only "Pause after each group to verify."
6. **Insert a pause after each task group:** After each task group's acceptance criteria, add a **"Pause for you"** (or "Pause for review") block that briefly says what to run/verify and that the user should proceed to the next group only when satisfied.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Spec & Requirements

Read each of these files (whichever are available) and analyze them to understand the requirements for this feature implementation:
- `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/spec.md`
- `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/planning/requirements.md`

Use your learnings to inform the tasks list and groupings you will create in the next step.


### Step 2: Create Tasks Breakdown

Generate `agent-os/specs/[current-spec]/tasks.md`.

**Important**: The exact tasks, task groups, and organization will vary based on the feature's specific requirements. The following is an example format - adapt the content of the tasks list to match what THIS feature actually needs.

```markdown
# Task Breakdown: [Feature Name]

## Overview
Total Tasks: [count]. Each group ends with a **Pause for you** checkpoint so you can verify before moving on. Some steps may require **Your tasks** (env, dashboard, deploy, etc.) and are called out explicitly.

---

## Your Tasks (supplement implementation)

These are steps only you can do; the implementation will assume they are done when needed.

| When | What you need to do |
|------|---------------------|
| **Before Task Group 1** | [e.g. Create database or add env vars as needed] |
| **After Task Group 3** | [e.g. Configure cron or deploy; verify UI in browser] |

- Testing focused exclusively on this spec's feature requirements

---

**Pause for you:** Run the full feature-related test set. Deploy or do a final manual check if needed.

---

## Execution Order

Recommended implementation sequence:
1. **Your tasks:** Complete any "Your tasks" when indicated (before/after the relevant group).
2. **Task Group 1:** Database Layer — then **pause and check**.
3. **Task Group 2:** API Layer — then **pause and check**.
4. **Task Group 3:** Frontend Design — then **pause and check**.
5. **Task Group 4:** Test Review & Gap Analysis — then **final pause and check**.

## Summary: your actions

- Complete each "Your tasks" row in the table when its **When** applies.
- Pause after each task group to run the relevant tests and, where applicable, manually verify (e.g. API in browser, UI flow).
```

**Note**: Adapt this structure based on the actual feature requirements. Some features may need:
- Different task groups (e.g., email notifications, payment processing, data migration)
- Different execution order based on dependencies
- More or fewer sub-tasks per group

## Important Constraints

- **Create tasks that are specific and verifiable**
- **Group related tasks:** For example, group back-end engineering tasks together and front-end UI tasks together.
- **Include a "Your tasks" section:** List any steps only the user can do (env, dashboards, deploy, etc.) with **When** and **What you need to do**. If none, say so.
- **Include a "Pause for you" after each task group:** So the user can verify (run tests, manual check, test UI) before continuing.
- **Limit test writing during development**:
  - Each task group (1-3) should write 2-8 focused tests maximum
  - Tests should cover only critical behaviors, not exhaustive coverage
  - Test verification should run ONLY the newly written tests, not the entire suite
  - If there is a dedicated test coverage group for filling in gaps in test coverage, this group should add only a maximum of 10 additional tests IF NECESSARY to fill critical gaps
- **Use a focused test-driven approach** where each task group starts with writing 2-8 tests (x.1 sub-task) and ends with running ONLY those tests (final sub-task)
- **Include acceptance criteria** for each task group
- **Reference visual assets** if visuals are available


## Display confirmation and next step

Display the following message to the user:

```
The tasks list has created at `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md`.

Review it closely to make sure it all looks good. Complete any "Your tasks" when indicated and pause after each task group to verify before continuing.

NEXT STEP 👉 Run `/implement-tasks` (simple, effective) or `/orchestrate-tasks` (advanced, powerful) to start building!
